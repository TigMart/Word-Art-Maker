have all these options of fonts so let’s say I want “some font name” font, you can
filter fonts also.

You also have the ability to change the **layout**. If you go to the layout, you can
observe many options for a decision․You can do the vertical, random, crossing,
negative, and positive, so I choose the random form.

You can set the **opacity** of the background image․ As you can see I gradually
increase it and along with it you are able to see more of the image in the back.

If you stop at the word it will **hover** and transform with an **animation effect**,
as you can see words appear at a given **rotation angle**.

If by any chance you want to change the words you're going to go to words and edit
the added words, you can also change words to **uppercase** or **lowercase** and
**capitalize** them.

After filling in the options I'm going to click to “**_visualize_**” to see how it
looks. And that's how it is going to look.
